- Categories / tags
- Simple profile (name, location, contact)
- Settings (font size, dark mode)
- Contact/Support screen

## Recommended Tech Stacks (choose one)
- React Native + Expo + TypeScript — fastest to prototype, great cross-platform support
- Flutter — single codebase, high-performance UI, strong for custom design
- Native (Kotlin + Swift) — best platform-specific performance, longer dev time

## Getting Started (example for Expo + React Native)
1. Install Node.js and Yarn/npm
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Initialize project: `expo init z_s_thought` (choose blank TypeScript)
4. Add navigation, async storage, theming libs:
   - `yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack`
   - `expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`
   - `yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
5. Replace README, add Brand assets (logo SVG/PNG), and start implementing screens.

## Next Steps
1. Choose tech stack and confirm target platforms.
2. Provide logo assets (SVG preferred) and brand colors.
3. I can scaffold the repo and implement the first screens (Home, Detail, Profile, Settings).

If you want, I can scaffold an Expo + TypeScript starter now — tell me and I’ll generate the repo layout and initial files.
