Quick start (Expo + TypeScript)
1. Install Node.js (16+) and Yarn or npm
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. From project root:
   - `yarn` or `npm install`
   - `expo start`
4. Open on device with Expo Go or build native bundles with EAS

If you want me to push this scaffold to a GitHub repo, create an empty repo and give me the owner/repo name and I will push the files there.
